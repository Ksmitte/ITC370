    <h1>About the Business</h1>

    <p>Plateau Cookie is a business ran solely by a woman out of her house. She has all the talent in the world and her bakery is ran right out of her basement. 
   Not only are the cookies pleasing to the eyes, but they are also delicious. </p>

    <h2>How They Are Made</h2>

    <p>All cookies are made from scratch and all made by hand. The decoration on top is all done by hand or an image is taken from the internet 
    and then printed onto the cookie and traced with icing afterwards.</p>
